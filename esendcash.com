Those pay day loans come to mind when a creditor is demanding to be paid ASAP or you end up worse than Shane Hurlbut at the hands of Christian Bale, but if you pay that debt, you end up in the streets because you won't be able to pay the rent. It is a no win situation wherever angle you look at. Your only hope is that fast loan that zoom money to your bank account faster than Tokyo's fastest bullet trains.

To Get a Loan or Not; That's Not the Question

When in this terrible fix, people have no recourse but take out pay day loans. They might plead another loan from family and friends if they're not onion-skinned. Or they may sell or hock their prized Zippo lighters collection just to get a good night's sleep and not worry about a Christian Bale look-alike hovering in the shadows. If they are smart they'll do odd jobs to raise the needed amount but if there is little time to do so, those loans can bail them out.

But if the issue is money for a dinner date or to buy a twinkling star in the galaxy, there's no need to rush yourself to get super fast pay day loans. You can always postpone your date or save money for that star because these things can wait. Your date will be willing to walk the park with you and as for the star, there are still billions up there so there is no real hurry.

The question is not whether you're going to get a loan, but the questions you should ask yourself are - "Do I really need these fast loans to save my life?" and "Will I be able to pay the loan on time?" If the answer to the first question is yes then you must be brutally honest if you can pay those pay day loans.
